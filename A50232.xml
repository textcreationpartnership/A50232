            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for our parts, whom the Lord hath made to dwell alone in this wilderness, when we hear of the afflictions of the Churches of Christ, though at a remote distance from us; There are two things which God doth certainly expect from us: 1.

               <q>At that Time there was a Great Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Church which was at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Evangelist having in the preceding Chapter sett forth the History of <hi>Stephens</hi> Martyrdome, proceeds in this Chapter to relate what things were <hi>contemporary</hi> therewith, and <hi>consequent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. In this Verse there are Three things mentioned as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable Events which happened either at, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Stephens</hi> Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sauls</hi> Consenting thereunto: So the Verse begins. <hi>And</hi> Saul <hi>was consenting unto his Death.</hi> Gr. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, It pleased him well. The expression intimates that others li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it; and that He liked it also. He did indeed manifest his Approbation of it, both by Words, &amp; Actions. And this is here mentioned as a thing very Observeable; that the Grace of God in Converting <hi>that Saul;</hi> in causing a <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Saul,</hi> to become a <hi>preaching Paul,</hi> (of which in the next Chapter there is a large Account) might be rendred the more gloriose, and illustrious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A great Persecution</hi> against Christians. The chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors had for some Time been restrained from doing what they had a mind unto, doubtless for Fear of the multitude: but when they saw the people patiently bear with <hi>Stephens</hi> Death, they were encouraged to go on in that way of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Persecution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Dispersion of the persecuted Christians at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> into other places. That's the last clause of the <hi>Verse</hi>

               <hi>&amp;</hi> Samaria, <hi>except the Apostles:</hi> which words Intimate a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dispersion. ALL does not imply that all, and every Christian in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did leave the City: but that very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did so; and that all the Preachers of the Gospel, (upon whom persecution is wont to light most heavy) except the Apostles, did remove. Therefore it is said in <hi>v. 4. They that were scattered abroad, went every where preaching the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the second of these particulars which falls under our present Consideration; <hi>viz.</hi> The Persecution which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Time of <hi>Stephens</hi> Death, which in the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is described,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Subject</hi> of it; <hi>viz. The Church at</hi> Jerusalem; which was then the only Christian Church in the World; the Gentiles not having as yet received the Gospel: So that <hi>the whole Interest of Religion,</hi> or <hi>Christianity,</hi> was here Strook at, &amp; endangered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Greatness</hi> of it; <hi>There was a GREAT Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution against the Church.</hi> It was so in respect of the <hi>Kind</hi> of persecution, which the Enemies of the Church were now come unto. Before this, they had persecuted onely with Words, and Threats: but now they proceeded to bloody Blows, Banishment, &amp; Death. And it was so, in respect of the <hi>Number</hi> of them that Suffered. <hi>Dorotheus</hi> writes, that at the Time of this persecution, there were Two Thousand Christians that lost their Lives. And it is evident from the Scripture, that there were many (thò the particular Number be not expressed) that then suffered Imprisonment, Death, or Banishment. Compare <hi>Acts,</hi> 26. 10, 11. where <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth; <hi>Many</hi> of the saints at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did I shut up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and when they were put to Death, I gave my voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; and I punished them oft, in every Synagogue. So that it might well be called a great persecution.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine from hence is,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the Church of God in this World, is sometimes a Subject of GREAT PERSECUTION▪</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101222:5"/>
            <p>Three things should be spoken to, for the clearing of this Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When</hi> men may be said to be perscuted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What <hi>Kind</hi> of persecution the Church of God in this world may be subject to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Reasons,</hi> whence it comes to pass that the Lords people in this world are sometimes persecuted.</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>When may a man be said to be persecuted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is, <hi>When a Christian doth suffer in the cause of Christ.</hi> There are three things necessarily implyed, in order to Mens being among the Number of the Lords persecuted ones.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They must be exposed unto Sufferings. Persecuted</hi> ones are <hi>passive</hi> ones. They suffer some Evil or other from the world. The <hi>Greek</hi> word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) properly signifieth a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of another: And it is sometimes used in a good sence: Thus, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 15. Follow</hi> that which is good. and Thus, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Follow</hi> peace, &amp; holiness. But usually, the word is taken in an evil sence: even <hi>To follow another to do him Hurt.</hi> When a man does pursue another with a resolved mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to cease, until he hath obtained his evil desire on him. Here is the persecutór, &amp; the persecutéd. In such a way did <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; those with him, follow <hi>David;</hi> and therefore does he say, <hi>Ps. 119. 157. Many are my Persecutors, &amp; my enemies.</hi> &amp; <hi>Ps. 142. 6. Deliver me from my Persecutors: for they are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They must suffer <hi>in a good Cause.</hi> A man may sûffer, &amp; yet, not be pèrsecuted; if the Cause that he suffers for, be not <note place="margin">Non Poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> being <hi>Protestant Martyrs,</hi> and the other three, miserable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. When our blessed Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, others were at the same time crucified also: They received but the due Reward of their Deeds, so did the penitent Theef
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101222:6"/> acknowledge, <hi>Luc. 23. 41. We suffer justly, for we recive the due Reward of our Deeds:</hi> when Jesus Christ (as tis added) <hi>had done nothing amiss:</hi> but was exposed to His sufferings for the sake of the Truth: because He did bear witness to the most gloriose Truth that can be mentioned: because He said, <hi>He was the Son of God, &amp; the King of</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>If men suffer for evil Deeds, they are not persecuted. The Apostle saies <hi>Gal. 5. 12. I would they were even cut off that Trouble you.</hi> They are not persecuted, who are exposed to Trouble, for unjustly causing Trouble to the Churches of Christ. When <hi>Achan</hi> had troubled <hi>Israel,</hi> and God by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him forth to condign punishment, troubled him; that was no persecution. And if men suffer for an evil Opinion (as well as an evil Practice) they are not the Lords persecuted ones. If the Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> had Censured those that held the doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> they had pleased the Lord Christ; who would not have looked upon the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> as a persecuted People. When <hi>Jehu</hi> put all the worshippers of <hi>Baal</hi> to death; and when that godly Prince <hi>Josiah,</hi> in an holy zeal caused the Priests of the High places to be slain; (2 <hi>Ki.</hi> 23. 20.) they were not Martyrs; none of them were so. There are indeed some erroneous Opinions, which if any be exposed unto cruel sufferings from men for them, they that afflict them are not to be justified. Nevertheless, such suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are not Martyrs. Others do ill so to punish them: &amp; they do ill in maintaining an Errour. Of so great Concernment is it, for men to have their Consciences rightly informed by the word of God, when they embarque themselves on the suffering side. Nay more, a <hi>godly</hi> man may suffer from men, and yet not be persecuted in the Notion which my Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unto; <hi>h. e.</hi> if he suffer in a cause not justifiable by the word of God. Hence the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> gives such a caution as that <hi>1 Pet. 4. 15, 16. Let none of you suffer as an Evil doer; yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed.</hi> A Christian may suffer; and yet not suffer <hi>as a Christian.</hi> A godly man
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101222:6"/> may fall into sin; yea, into scandalose Errors and Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and he justly punished on account thereof. To suffer Persecution, is to suffer in the cause of Christ. When <hi>for Gods sake,</hi> a man does suffer from the world. According to what the Church saies, <hi>Ps. 44. 22. For Thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</hi> Or, For <hi>Righteousness sake.</hi> Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10. Blessed are they which are <hi>persecuted for Righteousness sake.</hi> Or for the <hi>Gospels sake</hi> Mar 10. 29. Or, for <hi>Christ's sake</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Martyrs are called the <hi>Martyrs of Jesus,</hi> Rev. 17. 6. A man suffers in the cause of God, &amp; so is persecuted, when he suffers for his godliness. As 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 12. Cain slew Abel his brother, because his works were Righteous.</hi> Or, for bearing witness to any Truth contained in the word of God. As in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9. &amp; 6. 9. &amp; 20. 4. We read of them that were <hi>slain for the word of God.</hi> Hence one of the Martyrs when he came to die, held his Bible in his hand, before the people, saying, <hi>Behold! Here is that which has brought me hither.</hi> In such a case, Suffering is a blessed Testimony. Or, for opposing, &amp; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying against any thing that is condemned in the word of God. He is <hi>persecuted,</hi> that suffers for opposing any corrupt Opinion in matters of Faith, or Worship: which was the case of <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp; the three Worthyes; and of the Christians in the Primitive Times: and in these latter Ages also, the Churches of God have been subject unto horrible slaughters for opposing Antichristian Superstitious Doctrines; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Lords faithful witnesses began boldly to declare against the Pope, &amp; Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were exposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great &amp; grievous persecution, on that account, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture foretold it should come to pass. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 9, 13. He also is persecuted, that suffers for bearing witness against any sinful Practice. If a man set himself against the sins of the Times, for that his Life and Blood may be taken from him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4. &amp; Then is he persecuted. Then is he a Martyr. Such an one was <hi>Zechariah</hi> the son of <hi>Jehojadah;</hi> who was sto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101222:7"/> to death for his faithful Testimony against sin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 20, 21. And <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who was beheaded for bearing witness against the Uncleanness which some great persons in those Dayes Lived in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
            <p>But, 3. (one thing more) <hi>They must suffer from a Right Principle,</hi> h. e. from a principle of Faith, and true obedience to the will of God: a principle of Love to God; of Fear of His great Name; of Conscience to His will; and that they may keep their Consciences pure in His sight. <hi>If a man for Conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 19. If Conscience toward God; Respect, and obedience to His will, carry a man out in suffering, then is he persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Indeed, there are, in a more strict and Scripture-sence, <hi>No Persecuted ones, but such as have the fear of God in their hearts:</hi> Hence such are pronounced <hi>Blessed,</hi> Mat. 5. 10. and called Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. and 13. 6. which does imply their being in a state of grace. It is possible a man may suffer unto the loss not only of Liberty, but of Life it self; and that in a good cause also; and yet not be a true Member &amp; Martyr of Jesus Christ: not having a true principle of Love to God in him, 1 <hi>Cor 13. 3. Socrates,</hi> an Heathen, suffered Death ('tis said) for maintaining that there is but one God; and the poor <hi>Jews</hi> have sometimes been exposed unto great sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not comply with Popish, or Mahometan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions. <hi>Arians,</hi> and other Hereticks have sometimes lost their Lives in the common cause of Christianity, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan enemies have prevailed over them: yea, so have some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Idolaters done. There have been, that out of pride and vain glory, did suffer not a little. Ecclesiastical History speaketh of those that would Murder themselves, out of a vainglorious ambitious desire to be accounted Martyrs. But if men are acted, and carried out in sufferings from no better principles than those, the Lord will not own them for his persecuted ones.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a threefold Persecution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is the persecution of the Heart:</hi> when men do se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hate the Image of God in His servants; and therefore malign them, and wish evil to them: It is said, <hi>Ps. 129. 5. Let them all be confounded, &amp; turned back, that</hi> Hate <hi>Zion.</hi> Here persecution begins: There is an Hatred of Zion, which is no better than persecution. <hi>Joseph</hi> was persecuted by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when they Hated him for his godliness, <hi>Gen. 37. 2, 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Micajah</hi> was persecuted by <hi>Ahab;</hi> when he said, <hi>I Hate him, 1 K.</hi> 22 8. And thus, the Lords people are alwayes the subjects of great persecution: being much hated in the world, because they cannot comply with the evil manners of it. <hi>The world hateth you</hi> Joh. 15. 18, 19. And, <hi>Ye shall be hated of all men for my Names sake,</hi> Luc. 21. 17. Saies our Lord Jesus to His Disciples. &amp; This Now is persecution, yea, bloody persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the sight of God: For, whosoever Hateth his Brother, is a Murderer, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 15. If the Lord did not wonderfully restrain them, the wicked would serve the godly, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel.</hi> Inasmuch as they hate them, they would destroy them: For hatred doth not rest, but in the destruction of the thing hated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is the Persecution of the Tongue:</hi> when the Lords servants are Reproached, and Reviled, because of their Zeal for, and their Faithfulness unto God. We read that <hi>Ishmael</hi> mocked <hi>Isaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 9. Now <hi>Paul</hi> saies; <hi>Gal. 4. 29. He that was born after the flesh, Persecuted him that was born after the spirit.</hi> So then in such Mocking there is Persecution. Thus Christ saies, <hi>Mat. 5. 11. Blessed are you, when men perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you:</hi> Persecute you! How? Tis added; <hi>And Revile you; &amp; shall say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake.</hi> When Reproaches are cast upon the servants of Christ, on the account of their Zeal for Christ; then do they suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. <hi>Arians</hi> of old, would call the great <hi>Athanasius</hi> by the Name of <hi>Satanasius;</hi> and Papists used to call their Dogs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101222:8"/>
               <hi>Calvin;</hi> that so they might vilify that great Reformer: Names of Reproach are commonly given to the Lords ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: <hi>Hugonots, Fanaticks,</hi> and what not? And unto this kind of persecution, the Church of God is alwayes subject; more or less. It is said, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 12. All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer Persecution.</hi> Be sure, the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart; and the persecution of the Tongue, they shall suffer; however it may be with them, as to a further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. Therefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is the Persecution of the Hand;</hi> when Violence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Christians, because they are Christians; when they are deprived of their civil Libertyes, for professing the Faith of Christ: which was the case of those Christians my Text hath reference unto: and of the Church in <hi>Smyrna;</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom 'tis said, <hi>Rev. 2. 10. The Devil shall cast some of you into prison.</hi> Or, when their Estates are taken from them for that they are faithful to the Lords Cause; &amp; Interest. As it was with the Christian <hi>Jews,</hi> who took joyfully the spoilng of their goods, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. Most of all, when they <hi>Lose their Lives</hi> for their bearing witness to the Truth. They who so suffer, are by way of Eminency called <hi>Martyrs,</hi> i. e. Witnesses: <hi>(Rev.</hi> 2. 13.) because this is the Highest witness bearing that can be, when a Christian doth Seal the Truth he hath professed, with his Blood. Great persecutions of this sort, have sometimes (and many a time) been raised against the Church of God. Thus in the <hi>X.</hi> Primitive persecutions (under the Heathen Emperours) especially the last of them, the whole Church of God, and Interest of Christianity was persecuted. And after this, the <hi>Arians,</hi> who indeed called themselves Christians, did persecute the Orthodox as much as the Heathen had done before them. And last of all; <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> hath made it his Design to destroy those that have born witness for Christ; <hi>It is given unto him to make war with the Saints.</hi> And the Antichristan persecution must continue, more or less, for forty two moneths, <hi>h. e.</hi> for the space of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101222:8"/> twelve hundred &amp; sixty years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 21, 25. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (successively considered) is that Antichrist, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5, 7. Papists have been the most bloody persecutors in the <note place="margin">

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Whence comes it to pass that the Lords people in this world are thus persecuted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>Sin is the cause of it.</hi> Be sure, that sin which is in the hearts of the persecutors themselves, even the Natural Enmity, which they have against godliness, and godly men, is the Reason of the persecution caused by them. There is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the woman <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and from that enmity persecution does arise. <hi>Cain</hi> (the first persecutor) persecuted <hi>Abel</hi> to death because of this. Sore eyes cannot bear the light: Nor can guilty sinners endure the light of Gods Image appearing in the spirits, and in the conversations of His Saints. Tigres (they say) are put in a Rage by a fragrant Smell brought near unto them: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the fragrant graces of the Saints, put the Tigres of the world into a cursed Rage at them.</p>
            <p>Yea, and many times the sins which Gods people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are subject to, are the procuring cause of great persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By their own sins they provoke the Lord to put a sword into the Hands of their Enemies. The sins found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Churches of Christ, do this. For indeed, their transgressions do most of all dishonour, and displease Him. If his Sons, and his Daughters provoke him, He will surely
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101222:9"/> scourge them in the open sight of others. For Three sins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially:</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Apostasy.</hi> When <hi>Solemon</hi> did forsake God, the Lord rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up these, and those Adversaryes against him, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 11. 9, 14. The <hi>Babylonian</hi> persecution came on the <hi>Jews</hi> because their backslidings were increased. Therefore were they torn in pieces by Evening-wolves, by Lions, and by Leopards, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 6. And in the Dayes of the Judges, Enemies made havock of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> because of their going a whoring from God. By their <hi>Apostasies,</hi> they provoked the Lord; that He sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2, 13, 41. When the Lord strengthened the King of <hi>Moab</hi> against <hi>Israel,</hi> it was because <hi>Israel</hi> had done evil in his sight. So when the Lord left them to be oppressed, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the <hi>Midianites, Philistines, Ammonites;</hi> It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had left God, in departing from his holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous wayes. We need goe no further than our own Nation, for the confirmation of this. The <hi>Saxons</hi> (from whom we are generally Descended) became great Idolaters, serving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images, Canonizing Saints, and worshipping them; in stead of God in Christ alone. For which cause, God punished our forefathers with the <hi>Danish Persecution;</hi> and after that with the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sinful Divisions</hi> and contentions. If Gods people sit loose from him, or if they sit loose one from another, the Lord lets loose persecuting enemies upon them. When a shepherd sees his sheep scattered one from another, he sets his Dogs to drive them together. Persecutors are called <hi>Dogs</hi> in the scripture, <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. 16. When the Lords people are scattering, and dividing, the Shepherd of <hi>Israel</hi> lets loose those Dogs upon them. That was the case of the Primitive Christians: especially with reference to <hi>Aurelian's Persecution</hi> They were exposed unto the Scorn of the Heathen, and that on public Theaters, for their Contentions; and then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution followed. If Christians will not have peace with their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101222:9"/> Brethren; then they shall have war with their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Formality in Religion.</hi> When professors are generally grown cold, and lifeless in Religion; God casts them into a fiery furnace of Persecution: that life, and heat might be brought into them again. Thus does the Lord Jesus say to the Church at <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. Init. <hi>Thou hast a Name to live, &amp; art dead: Therefore I will come on thee as a Thief.</hi> h. e. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. Storms of persecution arise suddenly for this. The truth is, Formalists in Religion, are many times the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter persecutors. Though Formalists may be professors of the same Religion with the sincere; (as <hi>Cain &amp; Abel</hi> were of the same Religion; only <hi>Cain</hi> was a meer Formalist, when <hi>Abel</hi> had the power of godliness) yet the former sometimes persecute the latter to the Death. And it is just with God to punish His degenerate people by those that they are become like unto. And if we search the Records of former ages, we shall find, that an <hi>eminent Persecution,</hi> whether of the Church in general, or of the Churches in this or that particular Land, have seldome hapned, except great decayes as to Zeal, &amp; the power of godliness amongst professors, have gone before it, and made way for it. The <hi>British</hi> Churches of old, retained the Name, and Form of Christianity, (just as some in these dayes, have the Name of <hi>Protestants)</hi> but they were, many of them, persecutors of those that had the power of godliness in their profession, and coversations, (as <hi>Gildas</hi> a faithful preacher of their own, Testifieth) therefore the Lord first <note place="margin">Gildas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> plagued them by the <hi>Picts,</hi> (a sort of men not unlike our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians)</hi> and after that, rooted them out of their own Land by those <hi>Saxons, &amp; Angels</hi> which came out of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reas. 2. <hi>The power, &amp; malice of Satan, is another Ground of the persecution suffered by the Saints.</hi> Satan hath an Hand in all those persecutions which are raised against the Church of God. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. it is said, <hi>The Divel shall cast some of you into prison.</hi> If the people of God are cast into Prisons, for the Truths sake; It is the Divel that does it; whoever are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101222:10"/> the Instruments. And therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. end, we read of <hi>a Flood cast out of the mouth of the Dragon.</hi> When floods of persecution arise, they come out of the Dragons Mouth. And there are especially two wayes, whereby Satan brings about his Design of persecuting the Churches of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By Slandering of them.</hi> He is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>(i. e.</hi> a Slanderer) in the Scriptures. He raises evil Reports; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this and that Evil to be believed, concerning the Lords servants: as if they were Seditious, and Rebellious, &amp; what not? So 'twas said of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Ezra, 4. 15. <hi>This City is a Rebellious City; &amp; Hurtful to Kings, &amp; they have of old time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sedition within the same.</hi> Yea, so 'twas said of the blessed Lord Jesus Christ Himself, <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 2. We have found this Man perverting the Nation, <hi>&amp; forbidding to give Tribute to Caesar.</hi> Or, as if they were Hereticks, and held blasphemous Opinions, <hi>Acts, 24. 14. Stephen</hi> was accused for speaking blasphemous words against <hi>Moses,</hi> and against God. <hi>Acts,</hi> 6. 11. In the Primitive Times, Christians were traduced, as if they did not wish well to the Emperours under whose Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they lived: yea, they were charged with most monstrous both Opinions and Practices: as we see by the writings of <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and others; who were necessitated to publish Apologies for Christians, vindicating them from the malignant Slanders, which Satan and his Instruments had raised against them. They would put them into Bears skins, and then Dogs would devour them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By stirring up the Powers of the world against them.</hi> The Divel, for the most part, (though not alwayes) hath the Powers of the world on his side. Hence we read of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Enemy,</hi> Luc. 10. 19. And when it is so, he causeth great persecutions. When wicked Men, and those that are bitter Enemies to the wayes, and servants of God, have great power in their Hands, this is as Satan would have it; &amp; these he stirrs up to persecute. Where wicked Rulers are, Satan has his Throne. 'Twas said of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Rev. 2, 13. <hi>There
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101222:10"/> is the Seat</hi> (or throne) <hi>of Satan:</hi> because there was a wicked Ruler; a general Governour over that Province, who did reside in the City of <hi>Pergamus;</hi> and was Satans chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in persecuting the Saints. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. Its said v. 2. <hi>The Dragon gave the Beast his power, &amp; his seat, &amp; great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and then, tis added, v. 7. <hi>It was given to him to make war with the Saints.</hi> If the Dragon gets power into the hands of the Beast, bloody persecution is raised against the Church of God. And yet, neither Sin, nor Satan could cause the Church to be persecuted, without another Reason: without the Lords permission they could do nothing. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Reas. 3. <hi>The Lord hath an holy hand, &amp; glorious ends in all the Persecutions which befall his people.</hi> The Lord aims herein</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>At the glory of His own Name;</hi> which is his principal end. <hi>Peter</hi> was to die a Martyr: and tis said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 19. Christ signified to him <hi>by what Death he should glorify God.</hi> A man by Suffering, may possibly bring more glory to God in one hour; than by Doing never so much for Him all his life-time before. In this way, the Lord attains the propagation of his Church. The Church never thrives more than when (like a Vine) watered with its own blood. The more the <hi>Egyptians</hi> afflicted the <hi>Israelites;</hi> the more they multiplyed, and grew: <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 12. The Borders of the Church were enlarged by the persecution in my Text. It caused a Dispersion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <note place="margin">Ʋsher <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Some write, that a persecution raised by the <hi>Jews</hi> against Christians, caused <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and others to come over into <hi>England</hi> (then called <hi>Britain)</hi> by means whereof, the Gospel, and Christianity was first planted in the Land of our Forefathers sepulchers. When the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were persecuted, some of them fled into <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> others into <hi>Germany:</hi> whence also the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was spread abroad, &amp; embraced in those places. When the Papists raised a great persecution against the <hi>Bohemian
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101222:11"/> Brethren,</hi> they grew in numbers; many of the Peers of the Land joyning with them. And when some of their Ministers were banished, they carried the Gospel into <hi>Moravia,</hi> and to the remotest parts of <hi>Prusia.</hi> The Church of God in <hi>France</hi> wonderfully increased, when above an hundred years agoe, they were persecuted, and miserably oppressed by Popish Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. Though the Divel, and his Instruments design the Destruction of Christianity by persecution, yet the only wise God does outshoot him in his own Bow, and cause it to tend to the Inlargement thereof. The constancy, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Lords servants in their sufferings, does gain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers over to the truth; perhaps, convert many thousands to the wayes of God. This made the Heathen in the primitive Times, cry out, <hi>Veré Magnus est Deus Christianorum. Truly! Great is the God of the Christians.</hi> Sometimes their cruel E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecutioners, have been thereby Converted. And because of this, a popish Adversary advised that no more Protestants might be burnd to death: for (said he) <hi>The Smoke of such a Sufferer infected all it blew upon;</hi> and made them Turn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>At the Trial of his servants.</hi> The Lord Jesus said to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. <hi>Behold! the Divel shall cast some of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison, that you may be Tryed: and ye shall have tribulation ten Dayes.</hi> There was the persecution under <hi>Trajan,</hi> that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>ten Dayes; viz.</hi> ten prophetical Dayes: <hi>h. e.</hi> ten years.

Yea, at the last they are partakers of the greater glory in the highest Heaven for ever; because of the persecutions which they have endured. Their <hi>light</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions work for them a <hi>farr more exceeding,</hi> and <hi>eternal weight</hi> of glory. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4. 7. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. There is indeed a special crown of glory, which the Lord hath prepared, and reserved for them that suffer for His sake, and are <hi>Martyrs</hi> in His Cause. It is said to such, <hi>Great is your Reward in Heaven</hi> Mat. 5. 12. Hence were the Christians in the primitive times most desirous to suffer Martyrdome. How did they e'en long to be exposed to the utmost sufferings: because they knew there was a special crown of glory that such sufferers should receive!</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lord in those persecutions which come upon his people, aymes <hi>At the Ruine of His, &amp; the Churches Enemies;</hi> that way may be made for that. Persecutors must prevail,

Consider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and see <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28. unto this purpose. It is an evident token that destruction from God is hastening upon those that Trouble his people. The sin of persecution has alwayes been a Fatal, Ruining sin to them that have bin guilty of it. The four great Monarchyes, to their cost, have found it so. Persecution has been the Ruine of the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> the Ruine of the <hi>Persian;</hi> and the Ruine of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy.

Yea, tis seldome seen that the Lord bears long with this Iniquity: And notorious persecutors seldome escape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable strokes of the Judging-Hand of God upon them in this world: besides the Vengeance of Eternal Fire, in the world to come.</p>
            <p>The Application of this Truth remains, Wherefore use. 1. <hi>Let us be Exhorted to prepare for Times of Persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To awaken hereunto</p>
            <p>Consider. 1. <hi>What ground we have from the Scripture, to expect such Times as the Exhortation mentions.</hi> It is evident from the Scriptures of Truth, that great persecutions against the Church of God, are at Hand. It is said, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 1. This know also, that in the last Dayes,</hi> (&amp; how much more then, in the last of the last Dayes?) <hi>Perillous Times shall come:</hi> Times perillous especially on account of the great persecutions that the Church of God shall then become subject to. Indeed we expect gloriose Times for the Church of God on Earth: and we have ground from the Scripture so to do. But we have so much the more reason to expect great commotions in the world; yea, great, &amp; dismal persecutions on the Church: For, relating to the Revolutions immediately preceding the
<pb facs="tcp:101222:12"/> great glory promised to the Church upon Earth, it is said, <hi>Numb. 24. 23. Alas! who shall Live when God doth these things?</hi> It is the Lord's usual way to prepare his people for glorious Times, by great persecutions. What a distressing persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there, a little before the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> The greatest of the Ten persecutions: (that under <hi>Dioclesian)</hi> was it not just before the Lord raised the Great <hi>Constantine</hi> to advance Christians in all places of the world. In order to the ascension of the Witnesses, there is first a most horrible slaughter of them. And we know what is said, <hi>Rev. 12. 12. The Divel hath great wrath, because he knoweth he hath but a short time.</hi> It is so at this Day. Ere long, the Angel with the key of the bottomless Pit, &amp; with a great chain in his hand, will come down from Heaven, and lay hold on the Dragon, that old serpent, which is the Divel, &amp; Satan; and bind him, &amp; cast him into the bottomless pit. Therefore the Divel hath great wrath; &amp; Therefore the Church of God may expect great persecution. A dying Beast will bite cruelly: so is Antichrist, a dying Beast, His Day is comeing; his Time is well nigh expired: but, since he is going out of the world; we may expect that he will give a cruel Bite at the Church of God. Some of the Lord's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes, have often spoken concerning <hi>the last Conflict with Antichrist;</hi> which will be indeed, <hi>a short, but a sharp Trial.</hi> That Learned, &amp; Holy <hi>Usher,</hi> was, not long before his death exceeding confident, that the greatest persecution on the Protestant Churches, was yet to come.</p>
            <p>Consider. 2. <hi>What solemn Warnings the Lord hath given unto us, to prepare for Times of Persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God has given us Warning, by letting us know what bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy designs are on foot among the Antichristian Party against the whole Protestant Interest: A Design, the like whereunto has not been, since the Dayes of <hi>Haman.</hi> God has given us dreadful warning by Signs in Heaven: especially by that fearful Sight, &amp; great Sign which we, &amp; all the World saw
<pb facs="tcp:101222:13"/> the last year blazing among the starrs of God. Such things have sometimes presaged great persecutions on the Church. There was a Comet went before <hi>Nero</hi>'s persecution: The <hi>Arian</hi> persecution likewise was preceded, &amp; presaged by Blazing Starrs. God hath given us yet more solemn war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by what is already come upon the professors of the Truth in other parts of the world. There is a great persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raised against the Churches of God, in diverse parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> especially, in the Kingdome of <hi>France:</hi> which hath occasioned our being thus before the Lord this day; and which, I cannot but look upon as one awful Consequent of that Portentous Blaze which was seen in the Heavens this time Twelvemoneth. Many thousands of French <hi>Protestants</hi> los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their Estates: Many thousands of them fly into other Lands; being forced to leave their own. And there is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict come forth concerning them, more bloody than what came from the Court of <hi>Pharaoh: Pharaoh</hi>'s Edict was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy onely the Bodyes of <hi>Israelitish</hi> Infants: But now there's an Edict that reacheth further: An Edict for the destruction of the Souls of the Children of Protestants. An Edict to make Idolaters of them. Behold! Our Neighbours House is on Fire! It behoves us to look about us! The Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> were once <hi>(viz.</hi> in the Dayes of their King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV:) as unlikely to be oppressed by their enemies, as we <note place="margin">

Many of their greatest Nobility were on their side. They had great Armies and brave Commanders to stand up for them. They had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hundred walled Towns in their possession, for their safety, &amp; security. But trusting too much to an Arm of flesh they soon lost all, and lay at the mercy of their Enemies. We have no reason then, meerly because we are <hi>Protestants,</hi> and have the Truth with us, to think that we shall not feel the Cross, as well as our Brethren in the world have done. We have escaped it a great while. Our Land hath had rest above
<pb facs="tcp:101222:13"/> forty years: It is therefore Time for us to think of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for sufferings. Our predecessors, the Auntient <hi>Britans,</hi> living in a remote corner of the world, felt little or nothing of those general persecutions, which other Christians bled under. Nevertheless, the last of the primitive persecutions, fell heavily upon them. And whether the last of Antichrist's <hi>Persecutions,</hi> will not reach both <hi>Englands,</hi> the Lord God knoweth. It will be wisedome for us all to prepare for it. In <hi>England</hi>'s peace, we shall have peace. That there are special Designs against the Protestant Interest there, we are all assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Neither are we ignorant how awfully God has threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened us with Changes among our selves; as if He would pluck up our Hedge: and then the wild Boar would soon break in upon this Vine. If the Lord should be provoked to bring a Change upon us as to our Civil State: If that wall of Government, which hath hitherto been such a mercy to this people, should be removed; there are three Evils, that would quickly follow; <hi>viz. Superstition, Prophaneness,</hi> and <hi>Persecution.</hi> If the raines of Government should fall into Hands that are enemies to the wayes of Christ; we can in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son expect no better.</p>
            <p>Consider. 3. <hi>What Sins there are among us that call for such a scourge is this.</hi> Those very sins that are wont to be the Forerunners of persecution, are to be found in the midst of thee, O <hi>N-England.</hi> I shall not inlarge, but is there not a great decay of First-love? See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>Thou hast lest thy first Love.</hi> What follows? <hi>I will come quickly, &amp; remove thy Candlestick out of its place.</hi> How was the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick removed, but by a storm of persecution, which blew it down? This is the Issue of leaving First love! And have not we done so? It is indeed seldome known that an Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing people are brought home to God, but in such a way as this. We may then fear it; especially considering that other means have not prevailed unto our Reformation. Are there not Contentions? Have not we been like foolish little Birds,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101222:14"/> Pecking at one another, until the great Kite be ready to come, and devour one as well as another? Of late God hath let loose <hi>Indian Wolves</hi> upon us; in part, for this very sin, no doubt. And what further He may do unto us, is known unto himself. Is there not Formality? Oh! what Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! I remember tis observed, that a little before the great <hi>Parisian</hi> Massacre in <hi>France,</hi> wherein thirty thousand Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants perished, there was a great Decay of the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness among them: Formality was grown upon them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the extream dangers attending them, there was little earnest seeking unto God: but their minds were taken with worldly matters; the great concernments of Eternity in the mean time neglected. Oh that it were not too much so, with the generality of Christians amongst us! We have then cause to fear, and to be awakened.</p>
            <p>But what shall we do, that we may be prepared for suffering Times?</p>
            <p>I would say but two words by way of Direction. Labour for true Faith, and for Assurance, and you'll be Well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the greatest sufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour for Syncerity.</hi> O let us look to that, that we are built upon a right foundation; and then the House will Stand though the Floods come against it. Yea, though never such winds, and waves, &amp; floods of Temptation, and Persecution should arise; He that is by a true Faith built upon Christ, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all is done, shall stand. I know it is a Thought, that often times cometh into the heart of a child of God, If suffring Times should come, shall I be able to hold out? If my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession should cost me the loss of all that's dear to me in this world, what then should I Doe? And it is good for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to maintain an holy Jealousy over their own hearts, Self-jealous Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> endured the fire; and died a Martyr at the Stake: when Self-confident Dr. <hi>Pendleton</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Papist, and served the Times, to avoid persecution. But this is the way, to be sure to hold out, (come Life, come
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101222:14"/> Death) even to be sincere in the Lord's sight; To believe on the Lord Jesus Christ with <hi>faith unseigned.</hi> All the gates of Hell, all the persecutors on Earth, in conjunction with all the powers of Darkness, shall never finally prevail against any true Believer. Mockings, Scourgings, Bonds, Rackings, Tortures, the worst that Satan, and his bloody persecuting children can devise, will be endured, rather than Sin will be committed, or the Truth denied, where there is true Faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35, 36, 37. For Faith maketh a man couragious, and willing to venture himself in the Cause of Christ. It maketh him to fear God more than men. The sincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will say, as sometimes that great <hi>Confessor</hi> told his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, <hi>You may pluck my Heart out of my body: but you shall never pluck the Truth out of my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour for Assurance.</hi> In the Primitive Times, Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was not so rare a thing among Christians, as now it is: for those were suffering Times; and believers did need Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; that so they might be, at a Minutes warning, ready to be called forth to die, and to suffer for the Truth. If a man be called to part with his Estate; and he has no assurance of that which is better: how sad, and miserable will he be? When otherwise, he might be as joyful as they in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. Where there is Sincerity, there will be <hi>constancy</hi> in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: but Assurance is necessary, in order unto <hi>comfort</hi> in sufferings. It will tend much to the honour of Christ, when his servants are exceeding Joyful in all their Tribulation: For which cause, He doth sometimes bestow the grace of Assurance upon them at the Time when they are called to suffer for his Name; though before that, they had it not. One of our <hi>English</hi> Martyrs, that suffered in those Dayes when Popery sat in the Throne, as He was going to burn &amp; die at the Stake, cryed out in an Extasy of Joy, <hi>O the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come, He is come, He is come into my soul.</hi> O then Labour for this Grace. They that <hi>know in themselves,</hi> that they shall be <hi>rewarded</hi> in Heaven, if they be <hi>persecuted</hi> on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101222:15"/> Earth; will not be much Troubled, though they be deprived of their Estates, Liberties, Lives, &amp; All, in the Cause of Christ or for the Gospel's sake.</p>
            <p>Use. 2. <hi>Let us endeavour to Prevent this evil which I have been discoursing of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For although it be true as hath been said, If persecution do come, the event of it will, by the overruling Hand of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, be good; God will have glory, the Church will have spiritual advantage: yet it is not, in it self, a thing to be desired; but to be greatly deprecated. Wo to them that desire the evil Day: that Day is dark, and not light. When a storm of Persecution comes, what woful Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come therewith! How many Churches are thereby laid most desolate! How many Lives are lost therein! especially of the Ministers of God; and most of all, of those that are most faithful, able, and useful. Look for that! If a storm of persecution blow over into <hi>America,</hi> Some Ministers of God whom you now hear preaching, will be made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: A sacrifice to confirm the Faith of this His people. The Lord Jesus hath placed them in the forefront of the hottest battel. And such of them as are most dear to Christ, shall be singled out to be his <hi>Champions,</hi> and to lose their lives in his Cause.</p>
            <p>But what shall we do, that this Evil may be Prevented?</p>
            <p>I Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us be Humbled for those sins that might provoke God to let loose Persecutors upon us.</hi> Some may think, the best way would be, to comply with the Adversary: But I am sure This is a better way; even to be Humbled fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our sins. The wise m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n saies, <hi>When a mans wayes please the Lord, his Enemies shall be at Peace with him.</hi> Prov. 16. 7. O Let us be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the sins already mentioned: For that <hi>Apostasy;</hi> for those <hi>Divisions;</hi> for that <hi>Formality,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lukewarmness:</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is too general among us. And let us be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for one sin more. That is, <hi>Our great Unthankfulness for
<pb facs="tcp:101222:15"/> our precious Libertyes.</hi> Never any people in the world, had greater cause of Thankfulness unto God, than we have had. In respect of our <hi>Civil</hi> Libertyes; wherein we have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably priviledged; and which God has to a wonderment, continued to us. And in respect of our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Libertyes; The Libertyes of the Gospel of Christ, and of the House of God; which we have been blessed with. But certainly, we have not been so Thankful, as we ought to be: O be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for this!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us Pitty, &amp; Pray for the Lord's suffering servants.</hi> To pray for the peace of Jerusalem, is the way to prosper. <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 6. To be grieved for the Afflictions of Joseph, <hi>Amos,</hi> 6. 6. is the way to prevent the like sufferings from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon our selves. The Lord give us much of that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick spirit. Perhaps carnal Reason will say, It is not good to be so open in espousing a suffering Cause: we had better be more private. But <hi>Moses,</hi> who vvas a vvise Man, vvas of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mind: <hi>Choosing Rather to suffer affliction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> Heb. 11. 25. And let us give the world to see, &amp; know that we are not ashamed to own His suffering saints. Let us remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being our selves also in the body. So that if Enquiry be made of those that are going from us, to other parts of the world, What are they doing in <hi>New England?</hi> The Reply may be, They are Fasting, &amp; praying for the persecuted people of God in the world I say, if any ask of you, What are they doing in <hi>New-England,</hi> Tell them, that in <hi>New-England,</hi> they did no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hear of the persecuted Condition of the <hi>Protestants in France,</hi> but they set themselves, to Fast, &amp; Pray to the God of Heaven, for them. We shall not repent of what we have done; when God appears to take Vengeance on the Enemy. If we sympathise with the Lord's people in their present suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and sorrows; In the Day when Jerusalem shall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice; we shall be glad, and rejoice with Her: Even in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
